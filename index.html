              <p class="ae-3 fromLeft"><span class="opacity-8">Right wing populist leaders have sprung across the world, unprecedently amassing millions of fans and followers. These leaders are thought to share very similar ways of communicating with their intended audiences. But exactly what political strategies and rhetorics underlie their popularity?</span></p>
							<p class="ae-3 fromLeft"><span class="opacity-8">Pop Words tackles these questions by analyzing a corpus of speeches by populist right-wing leaders like Trump, Salvini and Bolsonaro. We work in the domain of political rhetoric analysis through close and distant reading methods such as rhetorical device analysis, topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and lexical space (complexity) analysis. We then create a formal ontology to conceptualize and formalize rhetorical strategies employed by Right wing populists (RWPs). While we first analyze and formalize the speech acts of RWPs, this ontology can be exploited for a variety of political content and speech acts, regardless of political affiliation.</span></p>

							<h1>Salvini - Piazzia Duomo Rally</h1>
							<h2>24th February 2018</h2>

							<p>You guys are a show! Thanks! This is a place of peace, of dialogue, of serenity, of the future. Violence does not belong to us, violence has never solved anything. And I want to do the first applause to the police who, when the League is in the square, are calm.</p>
							<p>I will not talk about the past. There are other squares that prefer to pursue the ghosts of the past: we are here to talk about the future and to imagine the future in which our children will grow. Just a quote for those who are passing these weeks of electoral campaign not to propose something for tomorrow but to do <span class="metaph">the trial of the ghosts of history that never return</span>. And I don't use my words:</p>
							<p><span class="quotes">"I wonder if this rabid anti-fascism that is vented in the squares today, to finished fascism is not at the bottom a weapon of distraction that the ruling class uses on students and workers to constrain dissent. Push the masses to fight a non-existent enemy, while modern consumerism creeps, insinuates and wears down the already moribund society”<span class="quotes">.</p>
							<p>Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1973</p>
							<p>Dedicated to those who look to the past because they do not have an idea of the future. What future do we have in mind? What future do I have in mind? First of all, today the day opened with clouds and rain and at this moment the sun is kissing Piazza del Duomo, so it means that <span class="relig">someone from above is helping us. And we thank the Virgin Mary and those who want to bring some serenity to Italy<span class="relig">. <span class="quotes">Serenity that foresees that there are well planted roots and a country like ours - as Benedetto Croce said - can only be defined as Christian</span>. So let's start from these roots, we speak from the <span class="cores">defense of our traditions, our history, our culture, saying no to someone for whom progress is surrogate pregnancy and child trafficking</span>. Never in Italy with the Salvini government children or women will be objects to be bought at the mall and never by law will anyone die of hunger or thirst. <span class="quotes relig">We want to take care of life, starting as the Gospel of Matthew said from the last</span>, we in the government will bring the last to be first. And I think of those disabled people ignored by Italian governments who will have an attention with us that they never had, because it is unworthy of a country to give 278 euros a month to an invalid civilian and guarantee 1000 euros to a cooperative that is enriched by exploiting the clandestine immigration. This is not generosity, this is exploitation also because I remind to those who follow us, to the millions of people who are following us, that helping a child to be born, to grow, to eat, to drink, to sleep and to study in Kenya costs 70 cents per day. The Salvini government, which is a good government that cares about the last, will go to Africa to guarantee those children a peaceful future without uprooting them from their countries. 70 cents spent there is money well spent. 35 euros a day to help someone sell drugs in front of our children's schools shout revenge to the world. 24 February: some values that will guide you: consistency, honesty and altruism. <span class="quotes">Consistency, honesty and altruism that were some of the values that an Italian exile of a few decades ago led to the last of his days as he died on February 24th 1990 and is a president of the republic that all Italians remember, his name was Sandro Pertini</span>. Honesty, consistency and altruism. The oddities of history, another February 24: February 24 of four years ago, February 24th 2014 spoke in the Senate and asked my namesake, Matteo Renzi, to trust the Senate. I look forward to March 4 to send Matteo Renzi, his friends, and we're almost there, and to keep all those promises that he didn't keep, giving hope. <span class="vs">What the last governments have stolen from us</span> and above all hope and it is that hope that thousands of Italians are asking me that I am meeting in the squares in these months. I am meeting in these squares and I am touching the desperation of so many old people forced to rummage through the boxes abandoned in the markets, because their pension does not even guarantee a lunch and a dinner. I think of the desperation of fifty-year-olds who lose their jobs and don't find them again. I think of the desperation of the many workers whom a multinational company fire with a click, those modern multinationals that Renzi likes so much to businessmen, who announce the closure of factories because it is more convenient to exploit workers abroad. Now with the governing league these people that got public money from Italian citizens by law will not be able to fire even one worker in Italy to hire him on the other side of the world. <span class="cores">We prefer facts to words</span>. I think of the frustration of many traders who are not here today because they are forced to keep their shop open, because they can't make it to the end of the month, and in exchange for the state over taxes, the bureaucracy offers them unfair competition those multinationals that with a click send everything to everyone but are making the historic centers of our cities deserts and maybe pay taxes abroad. We will defend the shops because the shops are life, we will defend the merchants because traders are security.</p>
							<p>I think of the desperation of those doctors, of those nurses, of those health workers who have been working in the hospital for 30 years to help the elderly and the disabled and whom someone would like to retire at 70. Deleting the Fornero law will be the first act of the Salvini government: this is the commitment that I reiterate today in front of the 50 thousand square of the cathedral. Some say it is right to be a truck driver, a worker, a mason, a policeman, a teacher or a baker up to the age of 67. It is doubly unfair. First, because getting back from the state the contributions paid after 41 years of hard work is not a privilege but a right, according to why retiring people when they deserve it means opening the world of work to the many boys of twenty who today run away abroad because in Italy there is no work. I think of the many entrepreneurs suffocated by a tax that reaches 70 percent and a bureaucracy that instead of helping complicates. And the commitment I take with you is to let the people who want to work, tearing up sector studies and spesometro, profitometer and everything that makes people waste time wishing to simply work, innovate and produce.</p>
							<p>I think of the many young people that I want them to be with me on stage because they are our future. Give a round of applause to these young people who will have to stay here to work and maybe even give birth to those children who are now born more and more rarely. I know that this week there will be in some Italian cities the protest of so many of those guys that you see speeding by bicycle to deliver this or that pizza, this or that package for two euros per hour and that are paid by the piece as in the chain assembly at the beginning of the last century. In government <span class="cores">we commit ourselves to restore dignity to work</span>. Two euros per hour is not work and slavery, and slavery in the Italy that I have in my head is not there and will not exist.</p>
							<p>I also think of the many teachers, <span class="vs">filled with promises from a left that betrayed them</span>, teachers who are attacked every day in class even because of a good school that has canceled the merit. In the country that I have in mind, in addition to rights, duties will also be important, in addition to it will be important to say no. How do you guarantee everything free for everyone? How do you guarantee that no one will be rejected anymore? What generation do you raise? What students do you raise? What parents do you raise? Those who, if their son brings home a note instead of taking it out on their son, go to school to punch the professor. The good school must go back to being a place of education, of respect, of rules, of growth, of coexistence, with the teachers who will return to being teachers and not the policemen. I have shared and shared many initiatives of President Trump, who unlike all the others keeps his electoral promises, but when he tells me that he thinks of putting a gun in the hands of the professors, he says something that in the Italy I have in mind it will never exist. Books enter the classroom, culture enters the classroom, respect enters the classroom. The model is to disarm the criminals, as Giulia Buongiorno said, and to allow decent people to be able to defend themselves, their children, and their work. A simple law that establishes a normal principle is already ready with our government: <span class="cores">in an Italian's home, in an Italian shop the legitimate defense is always legitimate defense</span>.</p>
							<p>This is the idea of a country that I have in mind, a good country, a country of peace, a country of dialogue, a country that opens its doors to those who deserve to have a future in these parts. I give respect to those who show respect and therefore our home will be the home of those looking for a future in this country, serenity and work. Dialogue yes but who instead of escaping from war the war there is the door in our cities with the Salvini government wins a single return ticket to return from where it arrived. Identity is accompanied by respect, tradition is accompanied by dialogue, this is why I will have the honor, the joy and the desire to confront myself with everyone, from the president of the council of this splendid country, even with those who do not think like me , because I am curious by nature I am willing to confront and, if necessary, in front of good ideas even to change my mind. So I'm ready to turn Italy for its 8,000 municipalities, listening to what has lost the desire to do Matteo Renzi. <span class="vs">Renzi fell because he cheated and because he shut himself up in his palace surrounded by his arrogance</span>.</p>
							<p>As president of the council, my office will be Italy, from Trento to Lampedusa, every day to listen, to meet, to understand, to confront myself with an objective that <span class="relig">I have drawn from the Gospel: with us the last will be the first</span>. And I think of those who were massacred by European rules that we would not have the right but we would have the duty to change. If these European rules massacre our farmers and our fishermen and force us to import thousands of tons of Tunisian oil, Moroccan oranges, Cambodian rice, Canadian wheat or fish from Turkey or these European rules or change or rag, because our children must eat the fruits of our land and our sea, because it means work and means health. I think of a country that invests in research and does not force the best of our children to go around the world doing university research, and I am thinking of Professor Giordano and his students and researchers at Italian universities who are looking for the struggle to search for tool to win against cancer and Alzheimer's have had to escape to Pennsylvania, because here at most you win an internship or a scholarship of a few months. The immigration that we will work to bring back to our home is that of the many Italian workers, of the many Italian researchers who will have to return to fill our universities to try to build a future here that the last governments have forced them to look for elsewhere, and I think to the 5 million Italians who emigrated abroad. Brothers who are listening to us at this moment from South America, Belgium, Germany, Australia, if you wish, you will be the first immigrants for which our government will reopen these doors, so that we can allow you to return to this country. This is the sense of a normal country, a normal country that does at national level, the one that the league does where it governs. <span class="vs">This is the only big huge difference between us and the 5 stars. There are those who chat and there are those who do</span>. And to do, it means that in the Lombardy region it is possible to guarantee the free nursery for tens of thousands of families that otherwise could not afford it. Doing means helping the severely disabled and the elderly who are not self-sufficient. Doing means having 4,000 women in the Lombardy region sick with cancer and being able to buy a wig to recover their dignity and their will to live that otherwise they would not have been able to afford, and this we would like to do for all Italians and for all Italians. <span class="cores">Doing means guaranteeing a contribution of up to 400 euros a month for millions of new poor, who are those dads and mothers who have lost their jobs, lost their homes, lost their dignity</span> and now go to ask for a piece of bread from Caritas. For separated or divorced parents, Italy will return to being a civilized country where those who fall will stand up and there are no Italians of the series b. A normal country establishes for the first time in the history of the Italian republic, and my commitment of honor, for the first time the Salvini government will have a minister who will take care only of disabled citizens, of their rights, of their needs, of their work, of their right to education too often denied. With us the last will be the first, but be careful with a difference with respect to envy and social rancor promoted to the government by the left. <span class="retquest">Do you remember the slogans even the rich in Italy must cry?</span> And to try to make the rich cry they have invented taxes on taxes and what a great result they have achieved I think the Monti government have achieved the great result of letting the rich escape from Italy, of making them go abroad to pay taxes to buy the home, to buy the boat, to buy the car, and if the rich run away who's crying in Italy? There remain the poor who pay more and more and always less. With the Salvini government those who are good will be rewarded, those who are good and successful must not be afraid of the tax authorities and the state but must return to Italy to bring back the money here to hire other workers and to increase salaries. Rewarding who deserves, lowering taxes to everyone, paying less to pay everyone, this is the result that we will bring home. <span class="cores">Pay less to pay all</span>. So yes, if I have been proposing to you as a tax friend, and instead of massacring you with the beatings of tax bills, it helps you to understand, it comes towards you, instead it explains you to hold yourself hostage with Equitalia for twenty years for a 30 thousand euro folder he calls into the office with a smile and a coffee possibly, as a civilized country does and tells you give me this tax bill for 30 thousand euros that never in life and could pay me give me 15 percent in cash, right away, and tomorrow he returns to work, returns to smile, returns to production, returns to pay taxes. She returns as a free man, she returns as a free woman, the state collects and the economy starts up again. <span class="cores">The single tax will be one of our priorities</span>. And then there is the relationship with the public administration, there are many good public employees who do their job well. There are some that are less good and that do their job less well. A country that awards merit increases the salary for public employees who do their job well, but removes those who do not make an accident from morning to night. Merit everywhere, even in public offices, to reward those who do their work that cannot be put on an equal footing with those who camp out with public money.</p>
							<p>You see, it is a country with the sun that we are talking about, serenely, quietly. In these minutes in Rome there is another square with people who do not think like me but who give my greetings and my respect: there are the PD, the CGIL, the NO TAV, the no here, the no there , but what is the beauty of Piazza Duomo? It is that we are proposing to our children an idea of the future. In other squares it is proposed a return to the past that brings only dangers and brings only anger. With bare hands and uncovered face and with a smile we will change this country, violence has never solved anything. This we have to keep very clearly in mind, because I believe in the signals, I believe in that 91-year-old lady I met in Trieste who told me “Matteo I was not well but I came to listen to you, I haven’t voted for years, but tomorrow I’ll go to the municipal office to ask for my electoral card because I trust you and I believe you and on 4 March I return to vote because March 4 is history'. And I think with pride and joy to the workers I met outside the Piombino steel mills who told me "my grandfather votes on the left, my father voted on the left, I have always voted left, but this time on March 4 vote because of the workers you are dealing only with you while Renzi now frequents more bankers than workers, more financiers than a VAT number".</p>
							<p>This is the beautiful Italy that I am touching with the hand to which I have the joy of shaking hands, of stopping to listen, to understand, it is a generous Italy even we know little. <span class="relig">I carry with me a rosary that gave me a Don</span>, made by a woman who fights in the street and I do not give up this anymore, because the last ones that become first means returning to struggle and go from words to deeds, getting my hands dirty , having courage, going around with your head held high; to be honest, <span class="vs">it's a value that for some has gone out of style with our government for corrupt, corrupt, mafia, and Camorra the answer is only the jail, there are no other answers than jail</span>. A country free from mafias, from recommendations, where you work if you are good, where in the university, in the chair you do not enter only if you are a friend of the friend of the son of the cousin of the brother-in-law of the relative, I in the university want the best of our boys, a few university barons at home and some thirty more to bring culture to our universities. <span class="retquest">Isn't that an incredible country we're talking about?</span> It is a country like there is on this banner of the boys of Verona where human beings will not be distinguished according to the color of the skin, I don't care where you were born, I don't care what your name is: if you are a good person, if you bring wealth, you bring respect, you carry job ports culture, if you are a mother or if there is a child that escapes from the war Italy is your country, but with rules. With 5 million Italians in poverty, with 3 million Italians unemployed, I open the doors of my house, however, until these Italians find a home and a job, very serenely those who choose the league choose a clear concept: <span class="cores">first the Italians. First the Italian</s.</p>
							<p>For public housing, for bonuses, for public contributions those who sacrificed themselves in this country have gained some more rights because we are victims of the only form of racism that has massacred the country in these years, and it is <span class="vs">the racism of the left one that applied the exact opposite: first to the rest of the world and then the Italians</span>. And instead those who choose league at March 4 first say our people, because our people are hungry for work, hope and the future quietly, serenely, with pride. A country that returns to normal, where electronic bracelets do not control workers who go to the bathroom, but control prisoners to see what they do and where they do it. Because I'm tired of always thinking about the rights of a few and not thinking about the rights of many, and I think of women in prison officers who live more like prisoners than criminals who control in jail, often paid even less. Dignity at work and open, beautiful squares, squares like this. Guys it's cold but give it a round of applause because today we change history.</p>
							<p>Thanks, for me it's a good responsibility. Promise me one thing: if I go to the government as I go to the government, we all go together to the government of this country, of course. We will spend five years together, five years to regain hope, which is what they have stolen from our children, beauty, the right to beauty; we have the most beautiful country in the world and there are monuments that fall apart, there are governments that sell off pieces of the sea, pieces of beaches, museums and monuments. Let us also focus on the beauty of this country. How does Italy with the beauties and riches that we have to not have a minister who deals with tourism? This we will do: the beauties, the culture, the music, the art, the poetry, the sea, the mountain envies us all over the world, instead of selling it out, the first multinational company values them. And if there are any European rules that prevent us from doing it or change them or ignore them. The Bolkestein directive does not exist for me. Hands off our beaches, hands off our first squares, our markets.</p>
							<p>I want to get involved without screaming but doing. The time of words is over, Sunday is the time for words. Sunday 4 March, if in this last week each of us and each of you gives your soul, your head and your heart, Sunday 4 March will be the day of courage, it will be a day of celebration, and <span class="relig">this year Easter will be truly for believers and non-believers an Easter of resurrection of liberation for this country</span>, I am sure of it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it. Beyond the polls, do you know what? That I am not the center-right wins this country for five years, but within the center-right will be rewarded the strength and courage of the League, which will be the first party in the center-right. I'm sure of it and it will be a guarantee of loyalty of consistency and courage. We keep the agreements, we do not betray, we never, never, govern with others who are not of our team. But why can I say this? Because we've never done it before. We have never supported <span class="cores">minestrone governments</span>. Clear ideas, courage, determination. A nice kiss to you my friend. Are you from Catanzaro? And it fills my heart that lady who came from Catanzaro, is worth double. I am from Milan, I have made less effort.</p>
							<p>I want to return to lead a country that is not the last in Europe. <span class="retquest">Do we have anything to envy of the Germans, the French, the Luxembourgers?</span> I do not think. We were convinced in these years that we are not as good as them, we are more stupid, we have less desire to work, we do not know how to make entrepreneurs like them, we do not know how to make craftsmen like them, because they have built a cage of their own to damage the Italian economy, to damage traders, artisans, small businesses. And <span class="vs">from here we will leave, going to Europe not with the hat in hand as did Monti, Letta, Renzi, Gentiloni, I bring you to Europe. I bring Italy to Europe</span>, I'm not going to ask if I can help my earthquake victims, please. I help earthquake victims, period. Rules or no rules, constraints or non-constraints. For some, bureaucracy is worth more than the right to life, the right to work. <span class="cores">First come the women and men of this country, then come external rules of Brussels, Paris or Berlin</span>. If these external rules help 60 million Italians to get better we will be happy to respect them, if these rules lead to hunger, despair, precariousness in Italy or the rules change or we stop paying. Or we stop paying to get us hungry, with a smile, by quiet people. And give a round of applause to those who are giving us a hand to set up our economic revolution program, I think of Giancarlo Giorgetti, Alberto Bagnai, Armando Siri, Claudio Borghi and the whole team that is preparing in ten days to have responsibility. of government. Women and ready men, women and men who may have been mayors for many years in their municipalities. In these electoral lists, other parties have invented parachute-paper candidates overnight, from region to region, from city to city. Someone, and it is a historical record I think planetary, planetary. We are used to the malpractice of those who are elected with a party and change party after a year. And we, by changing the constitution, will prevent it by law: if you change party, you will loosen your chair and go home, very simply.</p>
							<p>But there are some phenomena, those of the democracy of the click, those that select the candidates with clicks that for the first time in the history of the Italian republic have already managed to lose 15 parliamentarians even before the parliamentarians were elected, because they had not noticed to have nominated suspects, Masons, strange, varied and eventual people. Oh well, the difference between the speaker and the speaker. I visit so many lands in this beautiful country, for example they tell me: why only you because you have a Luca Zaia only in Veneto? Each region should have a Luca Zaia to guarantee functioning hospitals, roads, schools, hospitals. I think of the work done by Roberto Maroni in these five years and I think of the fact that with the Salvini government finally - finally - in the interest of all Italians, from north to south, Italy will become a more modern, efficient and federal country. Modern, efficient and federal, which respects the autonomies, which enhances the territories, which does not depend only on a decision of the central state or the European union. And let me say that it took you thirty years in this square, I heard them before and it is doubly a source of pride. And it is so many people who have told me it is the first meeting of my life that I hear about a politician, I have never been. You too? Hands up who has never been to a meeting. But where have you been until yesterday? It's nice. Eh well I tell you that if I did not win March 4 my elections I would have already won them today, because to have these hands that rise in a movement like this is the most beautiful recognition, to have thousands of people under this splendid Madonna who tell me "It is the first political rally I hear in my life". I am happy because I feel that the pride of being protagonists of the change of this country is reviving, and the commitment that I take with you is to keep one by one all the promises we have made, unlike the others we will do that that we are committed to do, and so be prepared because you will follow so many other rallies. Thank you, I say thanks to you because you give it to me, and the country is ripe to adopt the teaching of that genius who answers to the name of Gianfranco Miglio, who before many or before had understood that this country can to unite in the name of diversity and respect, a united country in the name of identities and work. What's more beautiful?</p>
							<p>How many different flags how many different colors. I see there the four Moors of Sardinia, who have come a long way to be here. And I speak of Sardinia because it is a land that more than others is suffering unemployment and forcing its boys to escape, and on 4 March there are two different ideas of Sardinia of Italy: one is that of the left that just in Sardinia by mouth one of his commissioner said "the Sardinian boys run away" - but the boys from Puglia and the Roman boys apply to the boys from Puglia - what this left-wing genius said, "what's the problem? If the boys run away from Sardinia, if the farmers, fishermen, shepherds run away from Sardinia, what's the problem? We fill ourselves with immigrants who will repopulate Sardinia”. In my opinion it is a councilor of the kind should be treated and hospitalized. Starting again from work, we can start from the earth. But this week I need you, these wonderful 50,000 people - I want to tell those who are watching us from home that unlike other parties or other unions to come to the streets they are not paid, but they pay from their own pockets the bus, the train, the plane and the car -. A beautiful square because in this square policemen and carabinieri are basically unarmed, without a helmet and with a smile, because they are our brothers.</p>
							<p>This is the beauty. I can't wait to start, I tell you: I can't wait to start. <span class="retquest">You are ready? But are you really ready?</span> Here, I feel a huge responsibility on my shoulders but it is a joy. As Giulia Buongiorno said “I realize that one day my two children I love more than anything else in the world will forgive me for the time I stole from them, because I expect to give it back to them by making them grow in a better Italy, like the one they have for me left my parents and my grandparents ". Italy that returns smile and hope and rights and rights. An Italy that applies a constitution to the end of which many fill their mouths but many have never applied to the government. A constitution that is Article 1 says that Italy is a democratic republic founded on work: it is not written that Italy is a democratic republic founded on exploitation and precarious work. Work is work and work will return to work, I guarantee you. A constitution that in article 47 - I dedicate this to <span class="nick">the award-winning company Renzi-Boschi</span>, I don't know where they are, I send them a big kiss, I don't know if Maria Elena is Bolzano or Lampedusa, surely she's not in Arezzo because in Arezzo not her hand greatly - however, article 47 of the constitution, which says that the republic encourages and protects savings in all its forms, go and tell the zeroed, the scammed of those banks that thanks to the European rules and the complicity of the Italian governments have lost their savings of a lifetime. I do not have magic wands but I am committed to these best Italians to do something simple once I go to the government: <span class="vs">to save the banks of others the Italians have been asked 50 billion to help savers in other countries and when it comes to helping there are no Italian money savers</span>. Well those 50 billion that are still in Brussels, the Salvini government is going to take them back until we have repaid one by one the savers who have been cheated by people who should be in jail instead of shopping in Corso Montenapoleone. The Italian constitution itself - just think that it is crazy stuff - in article 52 it says something that for some is almost subversive, it is the antechamber of fascism, they are strong tones, in short Salvini not exaggerate, be quiet, be good . I am the best person in the world and I will apply the constitution, which Article 52 recalls that the defense of the homeland is the sacred duty of every citizen, the defense of the homeland and of the borders is a sacred duty of every citizen. I do not understand why those who once lost their lives to defend the sacred soil of their community were heroes and those who speak today of defending their homeland, the former Italians and border controls are dangerous people. We have had dangerous people in government <span class="vs">in recent years, which led us to war at home not using tanks, but using finance, which has done more damage thanks to the European Union than in the previous two world wars</span>.</p>
							<p><span class="cores">Less children are born today than in 1917</span>. Do you realize that there is a need to restore normality, serenity and work in this country? I believe it. We won't make it alone. I am ready to meet, to listen, to talk, to get involved, we need everyone and I also thank those subjects those organizations that are giving us a hand despite never having had a league card in their pocket and have chosen and accepted to apply with us. <span class="relig">I thank and remember with joy the splendid square of Rome of the one million Italians of the family day, who said that defending the lives of children is a sacred right for every government</span>, and of this we will take charge of these values, of these emotions . I thank - the friend - the secretary of the autonomous police union Gianni Tonelli, who on behalf of all the law enforcement agencies agreed to run for office in Bologna, and I tell you that the League, which will win the center-right in Bologna, will win in Bologna. I thank those who made themselves available, I also thank the friends of the UGL who gave us their best men, because it is important to start from the factories, from work with the hands with the calluses, from sweaty backs, from those who struggle: here, the government in recent years we have had people who do not know the concept of fatigue, of sacrifice, of merit, otherwise there would be no people - think of that PD candidate in Trieste - <span class="retquest">a candidate of the democratic party in Trieste who had the tough to say that the Fornero law is the most beautiful law in the world. But where do you live?</span> But where do these people live? So guys I have no enemies, I have political opponents. I look forward to March 4 to return to give this country a serious government, made up of serious people, and Renzi will only be a distant memory: this is the commitment I take with you.</p>
							<p>But keep in mind that what I will do and do will not succeed in doing it alone, that you will need us, you will need us because I am at your service, I am among you to serve you, not to use you as it has made someone else. I am at your complete disposal, I give you my head, my heart and my life because our children, because your children, because this country deserve sacrifice to the end, deserve a real commitment, a concrete commitment. <span class="quotes">This is one of those moments in history - as the great woman too many ignored or denigrated and who I think is one of the founding mothers of this country, as this great woman said - there are moments in history in which to be silent is a fault and speaking becomes an obligation.</span> Oriana Fallaci said it and we do it today, but the obligation is not to talk but to do. This is one of those classic moments when those who are silent are complicit.</p>
							<p>I ask you this week, I ask the 50 thousand people in Piazza Duomo to go to the offices, factories, schools, construction sites, hospitals to wake up those who still sleep, to say that March 4 will either win or die, or change now or do not change anymore, those who do not choose ensure that for their children they choose others, <span class="vs">those who do not choose do not punish the dishonest politician, punish themselves</span>. Because those who stay at home and do not vote, the respectable people who do not vote, claim double the vote of the mafia, and to me the vote of the mafia sucks, and therefore I need decent people with a straight back who vote, who are interested , let them get excited. That's the beauty, I rediscovered the emotion of politics, and I hope to have returned to you the emotions of good politics, because good politics solves problems but warms hearts. I want to speak not only to your heads but above all to your hearts, voting is not enough, I ask for something more, it is enough for me and I need your trust: I ask you to trust me because I trust you, and who I trust is on this stage does not betray, that on this stage can not wait to move from words to deeds. And so I wish this day never ends, I don't know about you but I'd be here for hours, <span class="relig">the good Lord gave us this sun too</span>.</p>
							<p>Applause in particular on my right to the girls who are translating for the deaf people who are here in front of the stage, who are my joy, you are my joy. <span class="relig">There was a Matteo more important than me - which is not that of Florence - who wrote that the last will be the first. I look forward to applying by law that in our Italy the last ones will be the first</span>, there are no Italian b's, rights and duties equal for everyone, and so I thank you doubly. As I thank you for what you will do. Before coming here this morning, a message was sent to me by a young man who told me "I am coming with my three-month-old baby, arriving with my wife with my three-month-old daughter". This is the square of the league, this is the Italy of the league, an Italy that returns smile, hope and future and will be weighed not by the deficit-GDP ratio, the spread, the bund and the constraints. We go to the government and the first indicator of the success of our government will be that in Italy the children who are not being born come back to life because the boys will get back to having a job, they will be able to avoid running away, they will stay here to raise a family and grow their own sons. It is an ambitious program and I am very happy that in a week we will vote. I hope that many of you will be representatives of the list at the polling stations because we trust everyone but we don't trust anyone, and I would not want someone who does not take the true votes by inventing them in the voting booth, and then eyes and ears open and remember that the easiest way to vote Lega is not to write any name on the ballot paper but it is simply to make a cross on that symbol of freedom, on the cards that give you two crosses on the symbol of the League and Italy starts again, and Italy returns to smile, without great promises of the name of normality, respect and honesty.</p>
							<p>This is what I can offer you. Now I have to if not. I'd like to stay here a long time, but I imagine you have some commitments at home, I imagine there is some husband, some wife, some children, some father-in-law waiting for you. No? Are we here to the bitter end? Do we make the longest rally in the world? I can stop until midnight, are you okay? No problem. Send a WhatsApp "I'll be back a bit later than expected, it's worth it." Do you know what? What Sunday we win. Do you know what? Sunday we win. Sunday we win. And then comes the beauty. And then how nice, I'm just waiting to see the faces of those commentators, of those sociologists, of those political scientists, of those pollsters, of those journalists "but imagine Salvini ugly, bad". But no, here there are beautiful people, good people, patient people, but you fear the wrath of myths - someone said it before - they are patient people, who want to build. In other squares there are people who want to undo and go back, in this square and on the other side of Facebook for those who are watching us <span class="vs">there are people who want to build and want to move forward</span>. Who speaks only of the past and why it is no idea for the future and therefore we let them be anti, they are against, <span class="cores">we are we are pro, in favor of life, in favor of work, in favor of respect and in favor of a country that returns to growth returns to be the first country in Europe, which has nothing to envy and to ask anyone</span>. This is what we will do next Sunday, so thank you and do today what the council chairmen do once they have been in charge. I do it without wanting to lack respect for anyone, because then obviously rightly the president of the republic will take note of the fact that the Italians have chosen the center-right, and in the center-right they have chosen Salvini, so I don't want to get my hands on, but I want to do before the quirinale with you an oath. An oath that assumes the fact that from today ten years of construction, beauty, respect, work and honesty begin, from north to south, is what I carry in my heart. In the name of autonomy, federalism, languages, fragrances, beauties which are the 8,000 municipalities that make up this country. So before doing so at the institutional level I do it with you, because I want you to carry this day in your heart for years to come to be able to say "I was there and I was the protagonist of this change". Next week we have to get out of the net, life is not just the TV talk show, radio, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, next week I ask you to be 50,000 witnesses and apostles throughout Italy of the fact that change can be, that we are about to win and we need to take 60 million Italians who have only the desire for certainty and the future. And so before doing so institutionally I do it today, with my heart, in front of you in front of you who are here and in front of you who are following us from Italy and from all over the world. And therefore in front of you today, February 24, 2018, I pledge myself and swear to be faithful to my people, to the 60 million Italians, to serve you with honesty and courage. I swear to really apply when ignored by some Italian constitution and <span class="relig">I swear to do so respecting the teachings contained in this sacred Gospel</span>. I swear, do you swear with me? I swear, did you swear with me? Thanks! Let's go to govern, let's take back this splendid country.</p>

							<h1>Trump - Minnesota Rally</h1>
							<h2>10th October 2019</h2>

							<p>Thank you very much. Thank you, Minnesota. This is a great state. We are going to win this state in a very short period of time. Thank you. This feels like the day before the election. So we have 20,000-plus people inside. We just set a new record. And we have 25,000 people that we still love, outside. And close to 100,000 people wanted to come tonight. Thank you all. This is great. This is really great. Thank you.</p>
							<p>I want to thank our great vice president, Mike Pence, and Karen Pence, for being here tonight. It is great to be back in the Twin Cities with the freedom-loving American patriots who make our country run. You know that. You know it. For the next 13 months, think of that, it seems like yesterday, for the next 13 months, we are going to fight with all of our heart and soul, and we are going to win the great state of Minnesota in 2020.</p>
							<p>America now has the number one economy anywhere in the world, and it’s not even close. You know I’m dealing with China right now. They’re in Washington. We’re going to see if we make a deal. But they want to make it. We’re going to determine whether or not we want to make it. But they’ve been very nice. And today I got a call from one of the top representatives, he said, “Congratulations, Mr. President, on having a truly great, great economy”. That’s pretty nice.</p>
							<p>We picked up, since the election, trillions of dollars in value. And China has lost trillions of dollars in value. I will say this, if our opponent had won that election, you know what would have happened? Right now China would become the. It would be the number one economy anywhere in the world. And right now I can tell you they’re not even close.</p>
							<p>Our country is stronger than ever before because we are proudly putting, for the first time in a long time, we are putting America first.</p>
							<p>And I have to say, there are a lot of very beautiful red T-shirts in the audience. That was a record sale. They did very well. And I’ll tell you what: <span class="cores">cops love Trump, Trump loves cops</span>. Our bold pursuit of this pro-American agenda has enraged, and you know what’s happened, <span class="vs">it’s enraged the failed ruling class in Washington</span>. Not easy to get them out, but we’re doing it slowly, but surely. <span class="vs">These corrupt politicians and the radical leftists got rich bleeding America dry</span>. And they knew that my election would finally end their pillaging and looting of our country. And that’s what they were doing. And that’s what they continue to try and do. That is why, from day one, <span class="vs">the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election</span>, the election of 2016. They’re trying. They’re not getting very far. They want to erase your vote like it never existed. They want to erase your voice. And they want to erase your future. But they will fail, because in America, the people rule again.</p>
							<p>Do you remember that, just 19 minutes after I raised my hand and took the oath of office, The Washington Post, a terrible newspaper that doesn’t know how to write the truth, published a story, and in this case, they might’ve gotten it pretty correct, they said, “The Campaign To Impeach President Trump Has Begun”. That was the headline. Little did we know they weren’t playing games. Think of that. That was 19 minutes after the oath of office.</p>
							<p>Months earlier, Peter Strzok, remember, he and his lover, Lisa Page. What a group. “She’s going to win 10 million to one. She’s going to win. I’m telling you, Peter. I’m telling you, Peter, she’s going to win. Peter. Oh, I love you so much”.</p>
							<p>“I love you, Peter”.</p>
							<p>“I love you too, Lisa. Lisa, I love you. Lisa, Lisa, oh God, I love you, Lisa. And if she doesn’t win, Lisa, we’ve got an insurance policy, Lisa. We’ll get <span class="foul">that son of a bitch out</span>. We got an insurance policy”.</p>
							<p>And we’re living through the insurance policy. That’s what it is. The phony Russia hoax. “Lisa, I love you”. Now the do-nothing Democrat con artists and scammers are getting desperate. 13 months, they got to move fast, because they’re not beating us at the polls and they know it, despite the phony polls that you see all the time, their phony polls. You know, polls are no different. Remember I always used to talk about polls, I know polls very well. Polls are no different than crooked writers. They’re crooked polls. They’re crooked polls. No different.</p>
							<p>Boy, that’s a lot of media. Look back there. <span class="vs">That’s a lot of media. They are so dishonest. And frankly, they are so bad for our country</span>. They are so bad. And they could be so good for our country. They could be so good. And maybe they’ll change, and maybe they won’t. I’ve been waiting for a long time. After I won the last election, I said, “Finally it’s okay. Finally I’ll get some great press”. They got worse. They got worse. I said, “Finally, we’re going to get”. I said to the first lady, “Darling, we’re going to finally get respect. We’re going to finally get media and press coverage. It’s going to be great. Look at what we’ve done”. And I’m telling you, they did, they got worse.</p>
							<p>They know they cannot win. You understand. Well, if you didn’t understand, honestly, there’s no way anybody could win, because you’d believe them. If you believe them, there’s no way anybody could. Because it’s like 94%. I can do the greatest things in history, and they’ll make them bad to very bad. And if I do a neutral, something neutral, it worked out okay, not great, <span class="simile">it’s like, “Give him the electric chair</span>. That was terrible”. Right? No, this is the worst.</p>
							<p>These people and the Democrats, they’re partners. It’s a partnership. How about on the newscast, like the word “manufactured,” it’s manu… And every newscast, “Tonight, in a manufactured deal along the border”. The word’s never been used… All of a sudden every newscast is using it. It’s a talking point given to these fakers by the Democrats.</p>
							<p>So they know they can’t win the 2020 election, so <span class="metaph">they’re pursuing the insane impeachment witch hunt</span>. I’ve been going through it now for more time than I’ve been in office. Because, like Strzok with his insurance deal, this was before, remember this, this was before, that statement was made months before I took office. That statement was made months before the election took place. They said, “Just in case, we’re going to have an insurance policy”. That only means one thing, “We’re going to get him out”. So they’re telling us. We can’t let that ever happen again to another president.</p>
							<p>And Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, a lot of people, the great Mark Levin. We have a lot of great people. Lou Dobbs, great people. You know what they said? Every one of them, plus many others, “There’s no other man that we’ve ever met that could have taken it”. It’s true. Maybe I’m a little different up here. I don’t know. But I enjoy it. To me, <span class="metaph">I’m energized because we’re draining the swamp<span class="metaph">. The Democrats’ brazen attempt to overthrow our government will produce a backlash at the ballot box the likes of which they have never ever seen before in the history of this country. These are bad people. My phone call, as an example, with the president of Ukraine, was perfect. Everybody that looked at it. And the only reason I released it was that <span class="vs">the Democrats put out a phony narrative</span>. So I had no choice. And I don’t want to do that as president, every time a president from a country calls me, or I call them, we have to release the text. How can you do business that way? Who’s going to want to speak to your president? So the president of Ukraine reiterated today at a major news conference, on other subjects, that he was under absolutely no pressure. He doesn’t even know what they’re talking about. And he used the word, there was no “blackmail” during this call. He used that term. So in theory, that should be the end of it.</p>
							<p>Think of it, a president of the United States who’s made our economy, with a lot of help from all of you, frankly, but from Mike and from some of our great senators and some of our great people that we have with us, we made this the strongest economy in our history. <span class="cores">We’ve rebuilt our military. We’re taking care of healthcare like nobody’s been able to do</span>. What we’ve done is incredible. And by the way, we’re protecting your Second Amendment. If you don’t have me, your Second Amendment is gone.</p>
							<p>So we have the greatest economy, the greatest military. We’ve rebuilt our military, $2.5 trillion, because when I took it over, it was a mess. And what do they want to do? “Let’s impeach our president”. right? I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I think we’re going to have a turnout the likes of which we’ve never seen in the history of our country.</p>
							<p>So we were really forced, just to put it away, we were forced. I said, “Just do it”. Got the approval from Ukraine. I have to ask. I said, “Hey, do you guys mind?” They said, “That’s a strange request”. I said, “Don’t worry about it. Do you mind?” And they said, “Please, go ahead. Nothing was said wrong on that call”. So we released the transcript of the call, which was so good that that <span class="nick">crooked Adam Schiff</span>, this guy is crooked, he had to make up a fake conversation that never happened.</p>
							<p>A fake conversation that never happened, and he delivered it to the United States Congress and the American people. It was a total fraud. And then Nancy Pelosi said, “Oh, I think the president said that”. These people are sick. I’m telling you, they’re sick. And you know what? Had they waited one day longer, they would have had the transcript of the actual call, word for word. It would’ve been perfect. Instead, they released it, they went early, they said all these horrible things. You know why? Because they never thought in a million years that I was going to release a transcript of the call.</p>
							<p>So Nancy Pelosi, upon hearing a false story from a whistleblower that had no clue what was going on in that call, or somebody gave her very bad advice, but also hearing it from shifty shift Nancy Pelosi said, a day before seeing the transcript of the call with the Ukrainian president, “We’ve got to impeach him. We’ve got to impeach him”. Right? And then she saw the call and she said to her people, “<span class="foul">What the hell</span>? Nobody ever told me this was the call”. But she keeps going anyway because the press is fake and they play right into their hands.</p>
							<p>The do nothing democratic extremists have gone so far left that they believe it should not be a crime to cross our border illegally, and it should be a crime to have a totally appropriate casual, beautiful, accurate phone call with a foreign leader. I don’t think so. As our brilliant White House counsel wrote to the Democrats yesterday, he said, “Their highly partisan and unconstitutional effort threatens grave and lasting damage to our democratic institutions, to our system of free elections, and to the American people”. That’s what it is. To the American people. It’s so terrible. <span class="metaph">Democrats are on a crusade to destroy our democracy<span class="metaph">. That’s what’s happening. We will never let it happen. We will defeat them. I mean, look at their debates. These people are crazy. They want to spend $99 trillion to redo buildings all over the United States. I said, “What about China? What about Russia? What about India? What about all these other countries where that stuff is just flowing out?” It’s all right. Let him give you the answer. Man, did the cops act fast. He’s already gone. That’s unbelievable. That’s the fastest. You know I have. Look, I love law enforcement. I love the cops. I love the police, all of it.</p>
							<p><span class="vs">Minneapolis, Minneapolis, you’ve got a rotten man</span>. You’ve got to change your mayor. You’ve got a bad mayor. You’ve got a bad mayor. But you know what? The police… I’ve done this a lot and every once in a while we’ll have very little disturbance. It’s really. <span class="retquest">Actually, is there any place where we can have more fun than at a Trump rally?</span> And we’ve set every record at every place, virtually, that we’ve gone. And one of the big musicians said, “And Trump does it without a guitar”. Can you believe it? Without a guitar. But this guy. So I’ve had it a lot where. But sometimes it’ll take the police like 30 seconds, 50 seconds.</p>
							<p><span class="simile">It’s like Roger Penske when you watch him</span>, who’s getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by the way, pretty soon. He won 18 Indy 500s, 18, Roger Penske. But it’s like the way they change those tires, takes four seconds to change the whole damn thing. I say, “How the hell do they do it?” That’s the way these cops just reacted. That was a record. I think it was a. I’ve had good service, but I’ve never had anything like that. I look up, the guy is already gone. Ah, we love you with the red shirts. So now the Democrats are making a pathetic bid to save <span class="nick">sleepy Joe, sleepy Joe Biden</span>. And you know what? I’d love to run against him, to be honest. Anybody like that. If you can’t beat him in a debate, you’ve got a big problem folks. You can’t beat him in a debate, you can’t be president. Because what are you going to do against President Xi and Kim Jong Un. You can’t beat sleepy Joe, but now we’re going to meet with Kim Jong Un? I don’t think so. But he’s totally owned and <span class="person">totally controlled by the Washington swamp for many years</span>.</p>
							<p>Two months after president Obama put Joe in charge of Ukraine policy, they put Joe Biden in charge of Ukraine policy. Listen to this. And the press will not write it. They say, “In totally unsubstantiated charges”. Every time they talk about him. President Trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune. Now you know that’s a totally unsubstantiated charge. Really? It’s not an unsubstantiated, it’s fact. Joe’s son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days.</p>
							<p>By the way, whatever happened to Hunter. Where the hell is he? Where’s Hunter? Hey fellows, I have an idea for a new t-shirt. I love the cops, but let’s do another t-shirt. Where’s Hunter? Where is he? Here’s Hunter, being examined by <span class="nick">sleepy eyes Chuck Todd</span> or some of these people. Hunter, it’s so great that you’re here, sir. Hunter, I know they’re giving you approximately $168,000 a month. I hear they paid you a big check of $3 million. I just want to speak on behalf of NBC who’s absolutely one of the worst. I just want to tell you… Hunter, Hunter I just want to tell you I couldn’t be happier for you and your family and I know you don’t know anything about energy and I know it’s an energy company, but I think they made a great deal, Hunter. And then they fly to China, and I’m dealing with people right now. They’re tough as hell, those Chinese negotiators, and Hunter, who’s not too smart, Hunter. He goes in, he has a meeting, he walks out in his fund with 1.5 billion, with a B, one point five billion dollars.</p>
							<p>These aren’t the same Chinese negotiators that I’m dealing with, I can tell you. These are not the same ones, but we are doing very well in that negotiation. Now, think of it, where’s Hunter? Where is Hunter? I want to see Hunter? Hunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything, frankly. <span class="nick">Hunter, you’re a loser</span>. Why did you get one point five billion dollars, Hunter. And your father was never considered smart. He was never considered a good Senator. <span class="foul">He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama’s ass</span>. True. Thank you. Thank you. It’s true. It’s true. And they’re always saying the same thing. Yeah, he got a billion five, we admit it, they admit it, it’s nothing, but oh, it’s not that same thing, <span class="thirdp">president Trump made a totally unsubstantiated claim about Hunter Biden and his father</span>. It’s not unsubstantiated, <span class="foul">you crooked son of a guns</span>, it’s 100% true. 100%. Even the smart guys on Wall Street, and I know all of them, they are smart. They’ve never seen anything like that one before. I’ve called them. Does that ever happen? Never happens. Guy walks in, no experience, no nothing. Walks out with a billion five. Gee. Flies in on Air Force Two with his father, the vice president. Don’t forget, that’s when he was vice president. So China gives his son 1.5 billion. How would you like to have Joe Biden take over negotiations right now with China?.</p>
							<p>I don’t think so. Meanwhile, Biden allowed China to rip off America for eight years as vice president, and Barack Obama let him just rob us blind, and we’re not doing that anymore. Those days are over. The Bidens got rich and that is substantiated. While America got robbed, that’s what happened. Sleepy Joe and his friends out America, they didn’t have tough negotiations. I look at these trade deals and I say, “Who the hell could have done this?” If you didn’t… If you had no business instinct, no business ability, if you had nothing, if you’re dumb as hell, you wouldn’t make these deals, they’re so bad. I say, “Who made these deals? Who made these deals?” But we’re ripping them all up and redoing them and they’re going to be very good. Wait until you see what happens. Now that I’m your president, you see it. America is winning again and we’re respected again as a nation.</p>
							<p>A brand new report just came out as I’m walking on the stage. Hard to believe, actually. It turns out that Joe Biden was vice president, he worked with the so called whistle blower.</p>
							<p><span class="metaph">This is nothing but a partisan witch hunt, sabotage</span>, and I’m sure they’re going to say it’s totally unsubstantiated, but one of them wrote this story. Congratulations, by the way. That’s very nice. That’s really good. That’s the way you should do it. Good. Good. Good. In the twisted worldview of Democrats and the media, <span class="vs">it’s okay for politicians to ship our jobs to foreign countries, flood our communities with drugs and crime, and enrich themselves at America’s expense</span>. Their treachery is allowed because they go along with the rigged Washington game, and it is far more rigged. When I ran, I thought it was rigged, but this is crazy what’s happening. But <span class="metaph">if you refuse to bow or bend to the Washington swamp, which I could do very easily, I’d be much more popular. Folks, it would be so much easier</span>.</p>
							<p>I got it. <span class="retquest">I got to tell you, isn’t it much better when I go off script? Isn’t it better?</span> So much. It’s just… Hey folks, the greatest buyer of advertisements in the history of the world, Mike Lindell, My Pillow. I have never seen so many ads. I think he’s the greatest ad negotiator in history, and I told them, I said, “Would you do me a favor? All the money we spend on these political campaigns, if I gave some of that money to Mike, I think it would have ads every single minute of every single show”. I never saw so many. Anyway. But <span class="vs">the lawless political establishment will try to frame you</span>. They’ll persecute you. They’ll swear and just swear up and down that they’re telling the truth. When Nancy Pelosi was on television the other day … I have to say, I have to say I was very proud of George Stephanopoulos. I was very proud. It’s not often. She said, “No, no shifty shift told the truth when he said that”. Stephanopoulos said, “No way. No, no. It wasn’t the truth. It was a false statement.” No, no. It was the truth. He said, “No”. And she really believes it. So she’s either got one of two problems. She’s either really stupid, okay? Or she’s really lost it. Or maybe there’s a certain dishonesty.</p>
							<p>But they smear you, they spy on you, and they target your friends, your family, your staff for harassment, for abuse, for destruction.</p>
							<p>I came down to Washington with incredible people. We won a great political campaign. They were bright eyed and bushy tailed. that’s a nice phrase. They came down, they were happy. They wanted to turn the country around. They wanted to do great things. All of a sudden they get summoned and they get subpoenaed by Robert Mueller. <span class="retquest">How good was he as a witness?</span> Not too good and by people that were, I call them <span class="nick">the 13 angry Democrats, that turned into 18 angry Democrats</span>. It was disgraceful. So people that were going down, “Sir, what is this?” I look, “Oh wow, that’s a subpoena”. What the hell is this? They took people. I really mean this. They took people that were full of life and energy and vigor. We had just won the greatest campaign in the history of American politics, it’s true. It’s true. And they destroyed their lives. They destroyed their lives. They went home.</p>
							<p>I could name many people, one in particular, who came down, an incredible young woman. She was going to help people. She wanted to help people. She had causes that were so good. She wanted to help people, and she ended up going home, dark, dark. Her life became hell. They ruined people. They destroyed people, good people. People that ended up paying far more money in legal fees than they made. Than they made. They destroyed great people. They’re vicious, horrible, and the media was behind every single step. They destroyed so many lives. They destroyed so many lives, and they’re continuing to do it. And it’s a disgrace.</p>
							<p>When all of their ludicrous hoaxes have been exposed as frauds, these <span class="nick">sinister fakers</span> then tried to impeach you for daring to call out their own corruption. There’s nothing like <span class="vs">the dirty political establishment</span>, and I have to tell you, this is, friend of mine, very smart, brilliant guy, was with me about two weeks ago. We just got rid of the Russia hoax and then a week later the Ukraine hoax starts. I had a week of like, “I can think about everything perfect. It’s so beautiful”. And he said, “President”. I said, “Call me Donald. You’ve called me Donald for 35 years”. “I will. Thank you Donald”. I’ve lost all my friends because they’re all scared to talk. Honestly, I’m the president that they can’t talk to me anymore. It’s like they’re afraid. They respect the office. It’s true. They say, “President”. I say, “Do me a favor, Richard. You’ve called me Donald for 35 years. Call me Donald, please. I want somebody to call me Donald”.</p>
							<p>True. He said to me, I just told him call me. He said, “President, I can’t do it”. He said. So he says, “President, you’ve been here now for, think of it, almost three years. Can you believe we’re here three years?” We, we, it’s we. And we have to promise them no more than 16 years. Okay? No more. No more. 16 more years. I’m only kidding. Now they’ll go back. See, he wants to run for more. But he said, “President, could I ask you a question? It’s so important to me”. He’s a great businessman, very successful. He said, “You deal with all of these nations, these great, powerful. Who is the worst to deal with? Is it China? Is it North Korea? Is India? Is it Russia? Please tell me, Mr. Pres, who is the toughest nation to deal with?” I said, “You’re not going to believe this. It’s the USA is the toughest nation to deal with”. The USA.</p>
							<p>It’s true. Because we’re dealing with some very sick and deranged people. There is nothing that <span class="vs">the dirty political establishment hates more than a president that they cannot intimidate, own and control</span>. They’re trying to stop me because they know that I don’t answer to them, I answer to you. It’s true. I never say this. I don’t think I’ve ever said it in a speech, but they’ll find out if I did. <span class="metaph">They’ll give me Pinocchios</span>, he said it before, but I don’t know if I ever said this before. But I make, as president, about $450,000. I give it away. I don’t care. I don’t want it.</p>
							<p>I never hear anything. Can you imagine if I didn’t. I give it away to… You can only give it, you can’t keep it. You can’t actually make a gift. You can give it to your different agencies. So I can give it to health, I can give it to transportation, I can give it to military, but I give it away all the time. Now, and if I ever did… But it’s 450. If somebody stays from, let’s say, a middle East country in one of my hotels and we charge him 392 dollars and 53 cents for staying, and I never heard of the guy and I don’t want to hear about him, they say, “Trump is getting rich off our nation”.</p>
							<p>I lose billions being president. I don’t care. It’s nice to be rich, I guess. But I lose billions. If somebody rents a room someplace and they pay me two months in rent or hotel fees, I never heard of the people. I never know who they are. They say, “Emoluments”. Nobody ever heard of the word emoluments before. Emoluments. It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. I tell you, it’s cost me billions of dollars to be president. It really has. And at some point I’ll probably to prove that, and I look forward to doing it. It’s very easy. It’s very easy. And there is nothing that makes me happier than making that decision to run and win and straighten out the mess that these people have created.</p>
							<p>So in desperate attempt to attack our movement. <span class="nick">Nancy and Chuck, two beauties</span>, have given control of the Democrat party entirely over to the radical left, including Minnesota’s own representative Ilhan Omar. I know you people. I know you people. I know the people of Minnesota, and I want to tell you, and I also, at the same time, it’s both a question and a statement, <span class="retquest foul">how’d the hell did that ever happen? How did it happen? How did it happen?</span> Congresswoman Omar is an America hating socialist. She minimized the September 11th attack on our homeland. Where far more than 3,000 people died, saying, “Some people did something big deal. Some people did something”. She pleaded for compassion for ISIS recruits right here in Minnesota. Omar laughed that Americans speak of Al-Qaeda. You remember that tape? Speak of Al-Qaeda. But when we say something about the United States, you just don’t say America with any intensity. Remember that? Representative Omar has a history of launching virulent anti-semitic screeds, whether you like it or not. She’s said the US support for Israel is all about the Benjamins. She said that pro-Israel lawmakers have an allegiance to a foreign country. Omar wrote that Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them to see the evil doings of Israel and the United States.</p>
							<p>How do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota? I’m very angry at you people right now. She is a disgrace to our country, and she is one of the big reasons that I’m going to win, and the Republican party is going to win Minnesota in 13 months.</p>
							<p>Thank you very much. So we’re honored to have with us today a special guest, a man that really is a terrific talented writer. He knows a great deal about all those tangled lies of Omar. Mr. Scott Johnson of Power Line. He wrote some stuff, I can’t believe it. Where’s Scott? Where’s Scott? Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Scott. What a job. Man, do you have her figured out. The only problem is, Scott, it’s incredible talent, much more talented than most of these people that you heard about. The problem is they never pick it up. They don’t want to pick it up, but we pick it up, Scott, and the people get it and we thank you for your great reporting. Thank you. Thank you very much. And Scott reported everything about Omar is a fraud, including her name.</p>
							<p>Scott reports his sources told him that, quote, Omar’s legal husband was Omar’s brother and that she had married him for fraudulent purposes. You mean like coming into the United States, maybe? And as Scott says, “We have seen a plethora of congressional scandals in our history yet we have never seen scandals like Omar’s in Congress, and nothing gets done about it”. I hope that some of you people are looking, because what AOC has gotten away with campaign financing and what. I call it AOC plus three, that’s what it is. And Omar is one of the three. What AOC has gotten away with all of that money that she used for her personal self with campaign finance is worse, and nothing happens to them, but it happens to you, and it’s not fair. The fact is, we’re in a struggle for the survival of democracy in America. The only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand.</p>
							<p>Message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing defeat on November 3rd, 2020. With your help, we will win back the House, we will keep the Senate and we will win the White House. And we’re thrilled to be joined tonight by some incredible people that have helped me so much. One of your tremendous talented, tough, Congressman Tom Emmer. Tom. Also a man, you don’t want to fight him, and you don’t want to play him in hockey because he was tough.</p>
							<p>He just won, not that recently but pretty recently, and I was out here campaigning for him and working hard, and it turned out to be an easy race because everyone loves him and respects him. Congressman Pete Stauber. And a man who gets in the trenches, and he just doesn’t care. He wants to win for the people. He loves you. He loves this state. He loves this country. Jim Hagedorn. Thank you. And a great friend of mine with his incredible family. He’s a friend. He’s smart. I guess you’d say he’s brilliant. His education is incredible, his military career has been incredible.</p>
							<p>Then he ran for office, and now he’s a United States Senator from the great state of Arkansas, Senator Tom Cotton. Great guy. And Minnesota Senate Majority Leader, Paul Gazelka. Paul. Thank you Paul. Minnesota GOP Chairwoman, Jennifer Carnahan. She’s been incredible. I said, “Jennifer, are we going to win in 13 months?” She said, “Honestly sir, I’ve never seen anything like this. It’s going to be easy. Don’t ever say. Just assume we’re two points behind, okay?” Two points behind.</p>
							<p>You never ever. Please. Always just assume you’re a little behind, but we’re going to win this state by so much that people are going to be shocked. Ad plenty of other states too. We had a rally three weeks ago in New Mexico, and New Mexico’s a hard state for Republicans, hasn’t been won in a long time also. And we had receptivity that was unbelievable. The audience was 40% Hispanic, where we’re doing great. And you know, Hispanic, they understand borders better than anybody, better than we do.</p>
							<p>They understand safety, they understand their job, they don’t want people taking it away, they don’t want crime. They understand it better. That’s why we’re doing so well, but we’re in New Mexico, and I’m telling you, that was electric. But honestly, all evenings are electric. We haven’t had any bad ones. We haven’t. They’re all electric. A woman who headed up the great state of Michigan for me, a state that hadn’t been won in a long time by a Republican for whatever reason, but it hadn’t been won.</p>
							<p>I guess we didn’t have the right candidates, right? But a woman who would call me constantly. I’d say, “I don’t want to talk to her. She’s giving me a headache”. “Sir, if you make one more trip, you’re going to win Michigan”. I say, “All right,” I make the trip, I go back home. I get a call the next morning, “Sir, we need one more”. This went over and over and over, and we ended up winning the state of Michigan, and I said, “Who the hell was that woman that kept bugging me to go back to Michigan and speak just one more time every week? One more time, sir”.</p>
							<p>And her name is Ronna McDaniel. She’s fantastic, and she’s the head of the RNC. She’s great. And our campaign manager, a man who’s really been… They used to say that <span class="nick">Crooked Hillary</span> had a very very sophisticated campaign. After she lost, they said, “I guess it wasn’t sophisticated”. We had a sophisticated campaign. Nobody knows the world of computers better than this guy. Brad Parscale. Remember when they used to say it? You know, I never got credit. My father used to teach me, if you can do it for less and win, that’s good.</p>
							<p>He wasn’t talking politics. The last thing. He’s looking down. He’s definitely looking down, not looking up. He was great. He was tough, but he was great. But my father would say, “If you could do it for less and win, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. If you can build a building for less money than the guy across the street, and if it’s a nicer building and you can rent for less, you’re really… That’s like a good thing”. So in the campaign, we spent much less money than Crooked Hillary Clinton, much. And we won. And we won.</p>
							<p>We won 306 to 223. That’s a pretty big… Remember? Remember they said electoral college. By the way, when you run, if you’re running, the electoral college is like the 100 yard dash, and the total vote, you don’t go certain places. You focus. Electoral college. We have to explain to them, it’s different. So we won 306, and do you remember they sued to say one’s the 100 yard dash. You practice. One’s the mile. You practice. It’s a different race. Winning the total vote is much easier in my opinion. The electoral college, I had to go to 22 different states. For the total vote, I’d go to four states maximum, right? Much easier. It’s much easier.</p>
							<p>I’m all for it, but the electoral college is better for our country because it forces you to go places that you wouldn’t go. I love Maine. I went to Maine four or five times. I needed one point. Maine gave me one point. And what happened? What happened? I went there numerous times. Everyone said, “Why?” Because I was told by these fraudsters back here in the media that Trump cannot get to 270. He cannot get. They had me maximum, if everything worked, right? At 269. So I kept going to Maine, and you know what? We won that one point in Maine. We won it.</p>
							<p>It’s true. But I kept going. They say, “Why?” I said, “Well, first of all, it is really a beautiful place,” but we won the point. But they said, “He can not get to 270” and I heard this for months and months. I had such a headache, almost as bad as listening to Mike’s damn commercials about those pillows. Maybe I need one of those pillows to cure my headache. Does it cure headaches? I think so.</p>
							<p>But here’s the thing. Here’s the thing. So they said, “He cannot get to 270”. In other words, you can’t win. You don’t get to 270, it’s over. You can’t win, right? He cannot do it. There’s no way of doing it, and they were right. I got to 306. They were right. But I didn’t get to 306. You got to 306. We won incredible states. We won incredible states. We won Wisconsin, we won Michigan, we won Pennsylvania, we won North Carolina, we won South Carolina, we won Florida.</p>
							<p>What a run. Do you remember the evening that we won? I think… Look, forgetting me, I think it was won of all of us together because we all worked hard. I was the messenger, but we all worked hard. That was our victory, not my victory. But that was one of the greatest nights in the history of television, one of the greatest nights, and hopefully it’ll go down when we’re allowed to get all of this stuff seeded. You know, <span class="simile">it’s like a tree. You plant it. You plant it. It has to go, but it needs a little</span>.</p>
							<p>That’s why we need the four more additionally years. It’s got to grab on and catch, so they can’t destroy it. So they can’t destroy it. But I think it’ll go down, and I hope it’s going to go down as one of the greatest evenings in the history of this country, because it’s never happened, anything like that before. And these guys don’t even question it. They just sit back and say, “I guess he’s right about that”. I’ll never forget the night before, I was at a tremendous arena. The place was going crazy. It was like this, going crazy, and two reporters that hate my guts, they looked at themselves, they looked at each other.</p>
							<p>Famous shot. They’re looking like this and they’re saying, “What the hell is going on?” They knew. They knew. And I didn’t need Beyonce and Jay Z, and I didn’t need little Bruce Springsteen and all of these people. They’d get all these people. They’d come in because she couldn’t get a crowd. They’d come in, they’d sing. They got Bruce Springsteen. Okay? He’d do about two songs and leave. What happens is, they leave, and then everyone leaves with them, and she’s still speaking in front of the same lousy crowd. It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever seen.</p>
							<p>And then they complain. Sometimes I’ll use terrible word like hell. The other day I used the word hell. I got hell from… They said, “He used terrible language”. I used the word hell. It was so bad. But you’ve got to hear Jay Z, the words he was using, he was using the F word all over the place, and then the next day they say I use bad language. The word hell is a terrible word. These people are sick. But that was an amazing evening. I’ll never forget that evening. Look. Outside of your family and your children and things.</p>
							<p>I love you too, darling. It was one of the highest rated evenings in the history of television. You add up all those networks. Remember the woman crying? Oh my God. No, they weren’t biased at all. Now, another very special man who’s with us today, but he’ll never be a man to me, he’ll always be my boy, you know what I mean? Right? He’s my boy. He’s my little six foot six boy, Eric Trump. And the parents understand that, right? They may be big and strong and older. To a parent, a child is always their boy or always their little beautiful girl, and I know that’s probably politically incorrect.</p>
							<p>They’ll say, “It was terrible what he said about women. Terrible”. But they’re our boy and they’re our girl, and it doesn’t matter how old we get and how old they get, <span class="retquest">is that a correct statement?</span> And I’m also proud to endorse your next Republican Senator from Minnesota, a man that I’ve known, a man that is tough and smart, a man that’s running against somebody that’s never done a damn thing in the Senate, Mr. Jason Lewis.</p>
							<p>And Jason did a great job in Congress. Congressman Lewis, thank you very much, and thank you for putting up with all of this stuff because I’ll tell you, it’s going to be nasty. It’s going to be nasty. They’re going to make up stories about you. They’re going to say things that’s going to want to make your wife say, “Why did I marry this guy?” Just say, “Don’t worry about it. It’s just another phony story”. Thank you very much Mr. and Mrs. Lewis. Jason, thank you.</p>
							<p>And Jason, they can say that about Tom Cotton. He’s too perfect, this guy. He can’t say… They can’t say it about you, Tom. Anyway, good luck Jason. Do well. And I don’t know why, but with all of the great people I just introduced, for tonight, maybe this is the most important person, because I turned on a very good show in the morning. Fox and friends. They treat us great. I just want fairness. What a great group. Ainsley and Steve, and by the way, Brian has gotten a lot better, right?</p>
							<p>Brian was a seven, and he’s getting close to 10 territory, and Steve has been so great, and Ainsley’s just incredible. And sometimes, Pete Hegseth gets on there for the. And <span class="retquest">how good does Jessie Waters do? How good? Right?</span> Just some really great people. And again, Tucker’s been very good I have to say. He’s been good. Smart. He’s been great. Tucker, and the legendary Sean Hannity. Great. Number one. Number one show. Sean’s got the number one show. And Laura Ingraham is knocking them out of the park, Laura.</p>
							<p>And you go over, Maria Bartiromo, and the great Lou Dobbs. How good are they? Lou Dobbs. And many more. And many more. How about Greg? Greg used to hate me. Now, he’s good. Oh, we can’t forget. We can’t forget Judge Jeanine. I would be in such trouble if I forgot Judge Jeanine. No, these are… And there are many more. I just… Look, I’m just rattling some names off, but they’re just terrific people. They’re terrific people. But a man that I have to really say something very special about.</p>
							<p>So I’m watching Fox and Friends early in the morning, very early in the 6:00 slot, because I’m out of there pretty good, and I see a handsome young man named Bob Kroll, Cops For Trump. And he’s talking about this lousy mayor they’ve got. Now, he didn’t quite say that, but I say it. He’s talking about this lousy mayor that won’t let the cops, the police, the law enforcement. My father always used to say, “Son…” And he meant it to. “Never say cops. It’s disrespectful. Say police officer”. I said, “Okay Pop”.</p>
							<p>But honestly, the truth is with time, I love you guys whether you’re cops, police officers, law enforcement. I’ll call you whatever you want. It doesn’t matter. You are so great, so respected. You don’t even know how much our public loves you. You don’t know it. You don’t know it. You don’t know it. But I see this guy, and I don’t know if he’s done a lot of television before, but he was very effective and very good. And he was saying how the police aren’t being allowed to take care of this rally, and yet with President Obama and Bush and all these people, they were fine, fine.</p>
							<p>Everybody comes. They fall asleep at a rally. But they weren’t allowed to do the job for us, and they went wild. So what I want to do… Go home to Mommy. Mommy says, “I saw you on television tonight. I love Trump. Don’t you ever do that again”. “Yes Mom. Yes Mom”. But the job he did before the election, I came right here to Minnesota, and I pledged to address this really important issue, and it’s the issue of law enforcement. And when I saw this man, this great gentleman on television pouring out his guts, pouring out his heart. I don’t know him.</p>
							<p>He knows I’ve been good to law enforcement. He knows I’ve been good to, as my father would say, “The police”. He knows I love the cops. He knows that, and so does everyone else. I mean, it’s so many shirts, so many red shirts, and there are plenty of people here without the red shirts, and I want to just tell you, the respect that we have for law enforcement is unbound. It’s unbound. Come up here. Bob, come up.</p>
							<p>Thank you fellas. I’ll see you later. Thank you.</p>
							<p>Thank you very much. Thank you. Great people. Thank you. What a group. I think your very weak mayor made a mistake when he took them on. As you know, for many years, leaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers. I promised you that as president, I would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy, and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls.</p>
							<p>And I’ve done that. Since coming into office, I have reduced refugee resettlement by 85%, and as you know, maybe especially in Minnesota, I kept another promise. I issued an executive action, making clear that no refugees will be resettled in any city or any state without the express written consent of that city or that state. So speak to your mayor. You should be able to decide what is best for your own cities and for your own neighborhoods, and that’s what you have the right to do right now. And believe me, no other president would be doing that.</p>
							<p>If Democrats were ever to seize power, they would open the floodgates to unvetted, uncontrolled migration at levels you have never seen before. <span class="retquest">Do you think you have it bad now?</span> You would never have seen anything like what they want to do. But in the Trump administration, we will always protect American families first, and that has not been done in Minnesota. We’ve also implemented the strongest screening and vetting mechanisms ever put into place. We are keeping terrorists, criminals and extremists the hell out of our country. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. The president of Mexico has been incredible. We have now, 27,000 Mexican soldiers. They’re great, and they’re tough, and they are now protecting our border, and those numbers have gone down like this. Thank you Mr. President. We will not make the mistakes made in European countries, that allow a violent ideology to take root in our country, on our shores. We’re not going to allow it to happen. And as you all know, to protect our citizens from those who would do harm to us, I instituted a very controversial, very hard to get, travel ban on some of the world’s most dangerous countries.</p>
							<p>And the other day, one of the fake news reporters in the back said… They were talking about the travel ban, and they said, “Well you know, the president has lost in court.” They said, “Where?” “On the travel ban.” And he’s right. I lost, and then I lost at the appellate division, and then I won at the United States Supreme Court. Right? And he knew that, but he said I lost on the. And he was right. I lost, and then I lost again, but then I won, and we have the travel ban. But instead of saying, “He lost, and then he lost at the appellate, and then he won at the United States Supreme Court,” he said, “He lost on the travel ban”.</p>
							<p>These are very dishonest people. Do you understand that? Very dishonest people. In the Republican party, we believe that those who seek to join our society must embrace our values, honor our history, and love our people. Democrats also support deadly sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminal aliens into the heart of your communities, and we’re not letting it happen anymore. Republicans believe American cities should be sanctuaries for Americans, not for criminal aliens. My administration is taking historic action to secure the border. We have reduced illegal border crossings by over 60% since May, and <span class="cores">we are building the wall</span> faster than anyone ever anticipated it could be built. And this is a serious wall. You’ve all seen it. It’s going up rapidly, and you think that was easy? I had every Democrat in Congress fighting me, fighting me, fighting me. <span class="metaph">I had a lot of the rhinos fighting me</span>. They say, “See, he’s not getting it built. He’s not getting”. Let me tell you. You have every Democrat fighting you.</p>
							<p>We took it from here, and we took it from there, and we took it from all over the place, and we got that thing. That’s <span class="metaph">the biggest patchwork of financing you’ve ever seen</span>, and that sucker is going up, and it is the finest, it is the strongest, it’s largely 30 feet tall, which is the maximum height that they wanted. I went to the Border Patrol, and I sat down with 15 representatives of the Border Patrol, and I said, “What do you want? What’s your ideal?” I actually said, “<span class="metaph">I want to give you the Rolls Royce<span class="metaph">,” and they killed me for that.</p>
							<p>They said, “It’s not an American made product”. Yeah, they happened to be right. No, they’re right about that one. They’re actually right there, Tom. But I said, “I want to give you the Rolls Royce of walls. Tell me”. And they told me everything, and then we built some alternative walls. We built all different types. We built about seven of them, and then we had climbers come in. The one that worked the best was the one we’re building. It also, unfortunately… The bad news, it’s also the most expensive. But we got it for the right price. We got it for the right price.</p>
							<p>It’s steel, it’s hardened concrete, it’s deep, it’s high, it’s a thing of beauty. And it’s going to keep bad people out of our country. That’s what it’s going to do. And the Democrats knew this. Most of the Democrats four years ago, they wanted a wall. Now all of a sudden, they don’t want a wall.<span class="retquest"> You know why they don’t want a wall?</span> Because I want it. That’s the only reason. And I just thought of it a year ago. I said, “Man, this could’ve been so much easier”. All I had to do is say, “We don’t want a wall,” and they would’ve given me all the financing I wanted for the wall. What was I thinking? We’re not going to build a wall, and they would have forced me to build it. I would’ve… It’s true. Under this administration, we are also ending this administration. <span class="paradox">We are also ending the endless wars</span>. We have to do it, folks. We have to do it. <span class="cores">We have totally defeated the ISIS caliphate</span>, and I did that in rather quick time if you remember, because we have the greatest fighting machine, now. When I came in and was totally depleted. We have great generals, we have great warfighters, and they did it so fast.</p>
							<p>I flew to Iraq, I met with the generals, right? I met with the generals. I said, “I hear it’s going to take a year to two years.”. “Sir, we can do it in two weeks”. I said, “What?”. “They don’t let us fight, sir. They don’t let us fight. We want to fight. They don’t let us fight.”. I said, “I let you fight”. I said, “How come if they say it’s going to take anywhere from a year to two years, you say you can do it so quickly?” He said, “Sir, we’re going to hit them from the front. We’re going to hit them from the back. We’re going to hit them from the sides, from underground, from overground. <span class="foul">We going to hit the hell out of them</span>”. And they did. And we won very quickly.</p>
							<p>But from now on, we want to fight where it is to the benefit of the United States of America, not to the benefit of other countries. And we will only fight to win. We’re only going to fight to win. We don’t fight to win. We don’t fight to win. The Turks have been fighting with the Kurds for two centuries, and Turkey, as you know, is a NATO ally. But I’ve been rough on them.</p>
							<p>We’ve defeated 100% of that ISIS caliphate, and no longer have any troops in the area. We don’t have any troops. The troops have been pulled out. Where Turkey is carrying out now a very tough campaign against the Kurds, get them out. So Turkey is right now waging a very tough campaign against the Kurds. We got along with the Kurds, and we helped the Kurds. And don’t forget they’re also fighting for their land. You know that. But they’re fighting.</p>
							<p>So we have three choices. You’re ready? Here are the three choices. We don’t have any soldiers there because we’ve left. We won. We left. Take a victory, United States. We left. Take a victory, take a victory. Bring our troops back home.</p>
							<p>I told this story yesterday, I have to sign letters, it’s the hardest thing I have to do. I sign letters, “Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith from Arkansas. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Jones from Alabama. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Somebody from some great state, I’m sorry to inform you, your son has been killed in combat. I’m so sorry”. And every letter is individually done because sometimes the parents, they’re grieving, and they get together with other parents, and I don’t want to see that it’s like the same letter. So we do different letters. It’s the hardest thing I have to do. Hardest thing, it’s the hardest thing I have… I was telling Tom Cotton, it’s the hardest thing that I have to do. And I sign those letters, and it just, it breaks your heart.</p>
							<p>And by the way, there’s a time to fight. Nobody fights harder than I do. But there’s a time, and there’s not necessarily a time. But I send these letters out, quite a few. And sometimes I send letters out, it’s called blue on green, where we’re teaching people how to fight and then they turn the gun on our soldiers and shoot them in the back. And that’s the hardest thing for a parent. I have all of them. I know everyone. That’s the hardest thing for a parent when they get notification, because they learn how their child has died. When the so-called people that were teaching how to fight turn the gun on them, and shoot. We’ve had a lot of that, a lot of it in Afghanistan, more than we’ve ever had proportionately before. It’s a horrible, horrible thing. But I have to sign these letters.</p>
							<p>And sometimes I go out to a place, Dover Air Force Base, it’s a very tough experience. Mike Pence goes, I go, other people go, Tom Cotton goes. We go out there, and we meet the parents and the families, the wives, the children, the sisters, the brothers. We meet them, and we talked to them, and their son or daughter is being flown in from some far away place in a coffin, and these things are just impossible. I don’t know how parents can do it, even. And I’ll meet them. And we have a particular Colonel, that’s all he does. So good. So professional. That’s what he does. He said, “I greet the dead, sir. I greet the dead”.</p>
							<p>And what happens is this big incredible machine flies in, this tremendous cargo plane, and it flies in so powerful, so big. I’ll be talking to some of the parents, and they’ll act like they’re fine. I said, “How are you doing?” “We’re fine, sir. We’re fine. We’re really good”. I say, “That’s great”. And I’ll tell the Colonel, I’ll say, “Colonel, I think they’re doing great”. “No sir, they’re not going to do great. You’ll see”. And I didn’t know what he was talking about, this is the first time.</p>
							<p>Then we went outside to the runway, and this incredible machine is flying in, and it lands, and it comes over, and it pulls up, and we have military guards, we have incredible talented musicians that do this. That’s what they do. What happens is that door opens up, and the Colonel told me, he said, “Sir, when that door opens up, those same people that you think are okay, do things that you’ll never see. You will hear sounds like you’ve never heard”. That’s what he does.</p>
							<p>I saw that door open up with a coffin with a flag over it. The door was opened, and these beautiful soldiers, five or six on each side, lifting the coffin and walking down the runway, the plank, they call it, off this cargo plane. And I see parents make sounds, that were just 20 minutes ago absolutely fine, make sounds, scream and cry like you’ve never seen before. The Colonel was telling me that, “Sir, you’ll see things that you’ve never seen before. A mother who was fine 20 minutes ago, you think, breaking the military line and jumping off, and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter, jumping on, on top of the flowers, on top of the American flag.” I’ve seen this.</p>
							<p>Then I have all these people that want to stay. They want to stay. And I don’t want to stay. We were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days. We’ve now been there for 10 years. We were supposed to be in Afghanistan for a short period of time. We’re now going to be there for close to 19 years. It’s time to bring them home. It’s time to bring them home. It’s true. Time to bring them home. We’ve done our job, we’ve defeated everyone that we’re supposed to defeat. And now we are, we are policing, we are now policing. That’s what we’re doing. We’re policing. And that, as I said, no more respect for the police, but these are military people, and those are police, but we are now policing. We’re not fighting, we’re policing. And you know what? After all of these years. One other story, and I have to tell you. I go to Walter Reed on Friday, and I do it quite often. I gave out five Purple Hearts. And I meet people that are so beautiful, so amazing. I met five warriors, and one was so badly hurt, with the loss of arms and a leg, another one… they’re just very, very devastated. But these are great, great people. And I gave out the Purple Heart. And I see the parents, and I have to say, Walter Reed, I want to just say, the doctors there, the job they do, you know, you hear so many complaints about doctors and about the vets, and the vets’ care, and nobody’s done better. We got choice for the vets. We did things for the vets that nobody thought would be possible.</p>
							<p>But I saw these young men, and I gave them their Purple Hearts. And their parents were there crying. And one of them was so amazing. I said, “What’s your problem?” “Sir, my face was blown apart. My nose was absolutely just blown apart”. He said, “Sir, it’s incredible”. And I looked at him, I said, “That’s the most beautiful nose I’ve ever seen. What do you mean?” He said, “A doctor worked on my face for 10 hours in the field. He said there were a thousand fragments”. Now I don’t know if that’s right, but well, a lot. He meant a lot. “He said there were a thousand fragments. He rebuilt my nose with glue. He glued the bones together. He rebuilt my nose”. I say, “You have the most beautiful nose I’ve ever seen,” and it’s true. And his father came over to me, he said, “Sir,” father was crying, he said, “Sir, honestly, my son looks better now”. He said, “My son did not have a good look. He knows. Now look at it, it’s beautiful, it’s beautiful”.</p>
							<p>But these doctors at Walter Reed, and these Army, and Marine, and the medical doctors, they are unbelievably great people. And they see sights that you and I hopefully will never see. They see things that nobody will ever see, and there’s nobody like them. And I have to give a shout out to those people, there’s nobody like them. So in the case of Turkey, and Syria, and the Kurds, we could send in a thousand troops for a military conflict with Turkey. No, you don’t want to do that. We could hit Turkey very hard financially. Or we could mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds. I like that. You know? Let’s mediate a deal. But remember they’ve been fighting each other for hundreds of years, and we were artificially put there, in this case by President Obama. So we did our job. We knocked out.</p>
							<p>And I’ll tell you another thing, we have to be treated fairly. We have to be treated fairly. We’re not treated fairly by other nations. We captured many, many ISIS fighters. Most of them came from Europe. They came from Germany. They came from France. They came from all of these countries. And we called them, I called them myself in many cases, I said, “Take your fighters.” They said, “We don’t want them. You take them”. I said, “No, no, no, we did you a big favor. They’re citizens of Germany. They’re citizens of France. They’re citizens of these various countries in Europe. Take your fighters”. “We don’t want them, sir. We don’t want them”. And I said, “How unfair are we treated? We do them a great favor, and they won’t take the fighters”.</p>
							<p>So we’re doing some things that are pretty amazing. Every once in a while you have to change course, and do what you have to do. The United States has spent $8 trillion in the Middle East. We’ve lost thousands of brave soldiers, and tens of thousands of terribly wounded people, great people, their lives will never be the same. These wars produced only chaos and bloodshed. And all of the blood and treasure we sacrificed, made the Middle East, really it’s less safe, it’s less stable, and it’s less secure. And I say it all the time. <span class="metaph">The single greatest mistake our country made in its history was going in to the quicksand of the Middle East<span class="metaph">. We spent $8 trillion and lost thousands of lives. And by the way, the other side, we can talk about that, lost millions of lives. What did we do?</p>
							<p>So we’re going to pull them out, and we’re pulling people out, and we’re trying to make good deals, and we’re going to bring our soldiers back home, and we may need them for something else, and they’ll be ready. <span class="vs">Previous administrations lust for regime change</span>, and also <span class="relig">put historic Christian communities in vastly more danger than they were before we started</span>. They are some of the biggest victims of these power vacuums and reckless foreign adventures. The Christians, the Christians. And we work hard with the Christians. We have tremendous evangelical support. We work hard with the Christians.</p>
							<p>So we’re slowly getting out of the Middle East. We’re doing it carefully. And we’re rebuilding our military like we have never rebuilt our military before. When I came into office, a very prominent general told me, because it looked like we could have a big conflict with someone, said, “Sir, we have no ammunition”. We had old planes. We had planes that were so old, they didn’t fly. We had people going to the desert, the plane graveyards, airplane graveyards, picking up parts. I never want to hear a President of the United States hear those words again. I never want to have a President hear the words, “Sir, we have no ammunition”. Think of that. Think of that.</p>
							<p>Now, thanks to more than two and a half trillion dollar worth of investment in our military, we have more ammunition, more missiles, more rockets, more tanks, more fighter jets, and more of everything else than we’ve ever had before. And we have no choice. You look around the world, and we have no choice, unfortunately. <span class="vs">And the Democrats want to dismantle our military</span>. After years of building up other countries, we are finally building up our country. That’s what we have to do.</p>
							<p>We’re replacing the disaster known as NAFTA with the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA, a giant victory for our farmers, ranchers, workers in Minnesota. Congress should pass USMCA immediately. We hope that Nancy Pelosi can start thinking about passing some legislation instead of thinking about nonsense.</p>
							<p>And to protect our industrial backbone, I placed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel. I’m also fighting back against years of chronic trade abuse from China. And the supply chain of China, which was unbreakable, is now breaking wide open. And they understand that. And I don’t blame China for what’s taken place over the last 25 years. I blame the people that led our country that let that happen, where hundreds of billions of dollars a year was taken from our country to build China. It’s not China’s fault.</p>
							<p>In the previous administration, they put our nation’s natural resources under lock and key, including thousands and thousands of acres in a place called Superior National Forest. Last year, I traveled to Duluth and announced that we would be ending this injustice, reopening Superior National Forest, and restoring mineral exploration for the iron ore mines of Minnesota. Tremendous jobs. And now the iron range is back in business. The last time I was here, a man came up to me, he said, “Sir, President Obama took our heart away, took our life away". I’ll never forget it. A man, strong guy, had tears in his eyes. He said, “You gave us back our life,” because they took it away from him. We gave it back. Best iron ore there is anywhere.</p>
							<p><span class="vs">My administration is also fighting the Democrat socialist healthcare agenda that would obliterate Medicare</span>. Republicans will protect Medicare, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And for those of you that have private healthcare, health insurance, 180 million people, they are going to end it, obliterate it, and most people are thrilled with it. We are going to leave it. You’re going to have your plan the way you want it. And there’s no plan like those plans.</p>
							<p>Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb, right up to the moment of birth. That is why I’ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion, because <span class="relig">Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God</span>. <span class="vs">Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant Washington corruption. The Republican Party is the party of the American worker, the American family, and it’s the party of the American Dream.</span></p>
							<p>For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. <span class="retquest">You remember that?</span> Gee, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. Now you have a President who’s standing up for America, we are standing up for Minneapolis, and we are standing up for the great state of Minnesota.</p>
							<p>We begin this political campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for America. We begin this campaign with right now almost three years of perhaps the most successful administration in the history of our country. Together, we will help millions more citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.</p>
							<p>With your help, we will reelect, and we will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, fair, and lawful system of immigration. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America within 10 years. Nobody thought that could be done. Going to be done. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. <span class="cores">We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work, and the sanctity of life</span>.</p>
							<p>We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our great national motto, In God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who built this country into the greatest nation ever to exist in history. Our ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put a man on the face of the moon. Proud citizens like the people of Minnesota helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people.</p>
							<p>With your help, your devotion, your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and <span class="relig">one glorious nation under God</span>. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Minnesota, I will tell you this with great certainty, the best is yet to come.</p>
							<p>Thank you very much.</p>
							<p>And just in concluding, together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and <span class="cores">we will make America great again</span>. Thank you, Minnesota. Thank you.</p>

					<h1 class="ae-2 fromAbove margin-bottom-2">Cleaning the Data</h1>
					<ul class="grid">
						<p class="ae-3 left fromLeft"><span class="opacity-8">In order to analyze our corpus through distant reading methods, we had to first clean the data. The algorithm works through the following steps:<br> 1. The algorithm opens every single file of our corpus (.txt)<br> 2. Our data are processed by using the pickle module, which is defined as follows: “The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy. Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as “serialization”, “marshalling,” or “flattening”; however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are “pickling” and “unpickling”.”<br> 3. The data-cleaning phase is then divided into two sub-phases:<br> 3a. Make text lowercase, remove text in square brackets, remove punctuation and remove words containing numbers<br> 3b. Get rid of some additional punctuation and nonsensical text that was missed the first time around.<br> 4. The data are saved in different formats, in order to be used for different purposes, and a Document Term Matrix is created and saved on the go.<br> Everything is exported in a pickle file (.pkl). This is the list of the file exported:<br> corpus.pkl<br> data_clean.pkl<br> dtm.pkl (document term matrix)<br>cv.pkl (count vectorizer)<br> Here you can find the python code we developed for the cleaning the data and compiling the corpus</span></p>

					<p class="ae-3 left fromLeft"><span class="opacity-8"></span>First of all, we analyzed the sentiment for every speech by using an easy-to-use library for Python called <a href="https://github.com/AYLIEN/aylien_textapi_python">AYLIEN</a>. This tool returns a sentiment analysis in natural language (positive, negative, neutral, etc). You can find the Python code below.</p>
					<p class="ae-3 left fromLeft"><span class="opacity-8"></span>	We then wanted something more sophisticated, that could provide us with a more complex and comparable result. We decided to use <a href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/">TextBlob</a>, which -differently from Aylien - can return numeric results both for the sentiment and for the objectivity. In particular, the results of this tool are in the range:<br>
						Polarity: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.<br>
						Subjectivity: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.</p>
